Create the participant's two MCP identities and mint a Service API key for each.

WHY TWO USERS RATHER THAN ONE SERVICE USER WITH TWO KEYS
--------------------------------------------------------
CSP mints API keys for the *calling* identity — POST /v2/current_api_keys, the
endpoint the estate's deploy_api_key.py already uses. There is no confirmed
endpoint for minting a key on behalf of a different user, so rather than guess
one, this script does what the API actually supports:

    for each role (read-only, read/write):
        create a user in the group carrying that role   (POST /v2/users)
        set its password                                (POST /v2/users/{id}/password)
        sign in AS that user                            (POST /v2/session/users/sign_in)
        switch into the sandbox account                 (POST /v2/session/account_switch)
        mint a key for itself                           (POST /v2/current_api_keys)

Every call above is already in production elsewhere in this estate. The
read-only/read-write split comes from group membership, which is exactly where
CSP puts it — so the RBAC lesson in Challenge 5 is enforced by the platform, not
simulated by the lab.

The two keys:

    read-only    Challenges 1, 2 and the diagnosis half of 3; and again for the
                 RBAC exercise in Challenge 5
    read/write   introduced at Challenge 3 step 5, once the learner has reviewed
                 the agent's proposed changes and approved them

The Infoblox MCP Server has no dry-run mode — write verbs execute immediately.
Two keys is how the lab models the right operational pattern rather than just
describing it. The handover is real: the agent re-reads its key file every turn,
so 03/setup-shell swapping the file genuinely changes what the agent can do.

Both keys are written mode 0600 and never echoed to stdout.

Usage:
    python3 provision_mcp_keys.py            create both users + both keys
    python3 provision_mcp_keys.py --verify   confirm both keys authenticate
