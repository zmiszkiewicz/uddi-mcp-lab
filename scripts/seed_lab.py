"""
The one entry point that puts a tenant into the exact state the track expects.

    python3 seed_lab.py                      baseline, then every break, then assert
    python3 seed_lab.py --baseline-only      healthy footprint, no breaks
    python3 seed_lab.py --break dhcp_range_overlap   one break, on its own
    python3 seed_lab.py --assert-only        change nothing, just verify
    python3 seed_lab.py --fix dns_stale_forward     undo one break
    python3 seed_lab.py --list               show the break registry

Idempotent throughout. Running it twice against the same tenant converges on the
same state — every baseline builder looks its object up before creating it, and
every break is a PATCH to a known value rather than a relative change.

EXIT CODES
  0  everything asserted clean
  1  at least one break did not land, or the baseline is incomplete

Non-zero here is load-bearing. track_scripts/setup-shell runs this with
`set -e`, so a silent seeding failure becomes a red "setup failed" screen at
track start rather than a participant spending fifteen minutes hunting a fault
that was never applied.
